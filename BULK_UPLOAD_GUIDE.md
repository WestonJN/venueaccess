# Bulk Upload & Database Functionality

## 🎉 New Features Added!

### ✅ **Excel/CSV Upload Functionality**
Your venue access app now supports bulk uploading of people through Excel and CSV files!

### ✅ **Enhanced Database Management**
The app now works as a proper access control system that checks against a pre-populated database.

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **Upload Process**
1. **Go to "Manage Access" tab**
2. **Click "Bulk Upload" button** (green button next to "Add Person")
3. **Download the template** or use your own Excel/CSV file
4. **Select your file** (supports .csv, .xlsx, .xls)
5. **Preview and validate** your data
6. **Upload** - the system will generate QR codes automatically

### **Required File Format**
| Column Name | Required | Description | Example |
|-------------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | ✅ Yes | Full name of the person | John Doe |
| `email` | ❌ No | Email address | john@example.com |
| `phone` | ❌ No | Phone number | +1234567890 |
| `hasAccess` | ❌ No | Access permission | true/false, yes/no, 1/0 |

### **Sample CSV Content**
```csv
name,email,phone,hasAccess
John Doe,john.doe@example.com,+1234567890,true
Jane Smith,jane.smith@example.com,+0987654321,true
Bob Johnson,bob.johnson@example.com,,false
Alice Brown,alice@example.com,+1122334455,yes
```

## 🎯 **Enhanced QR Scanner Features**

### **Database Statistics Dashboard**

### **Smart Search & Lookup**
- **Real-time search** through the entire database
- **Search by name, email, or phone**

### **Access Verification Flow**
1. **QR Code Scanned** → System looks up person in database
2. **Person Found** → Checks access permission
   - ✅ **Access Granted**: Person has permission
   - ❌ **Access Denied**: Person lacks permission
   - ⚠️ **Not Found**: Person not in database
3. **Log Entry Created** → All attempts are recorded

## 💾 **Data Management Features**

### **Export Functionality**
- **Export all data** to JSON format
- **Backup your database** regularly

- **Preserves existing QR codes**

### **Data Persistence**
- **Local storage** for immediate use
- **Automatic QR generation** for all uploads
- **Complete audit trail** of access attempts

## 🚀 **Perfect for Real-World Use**

### **Typical Workflow**
1. **Pre-event**: Upload Excel file with all expected attendees
2. **Event day**: Use QR scanner to verify access
3. **Manual backup**: Search and manually grant access if needed
4. **Post-event**: Export logs for record keeping

### **Use Cases**
- ✅ **Corporate events** - Upload employee lists
- ✅ **Conferences** - Import attendee registrations  
- ✅ **Weddings** - Guest list management

- **Complete logging** of all access attempts
- **Timestamps** for every scan/manual grant
- **Method tracking** (QR scan vs manual)
- **Success/failure records**

### **Access Control**
- **Permission-based** - only people with `hasAccess: true` can enter
- **Real-time verification** against database
- **Visual confirmation** of access status
